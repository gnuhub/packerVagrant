#
# To do
# * Create hosts file from template, not executing shell commands.
# * Create WAS rsp file from a template & place local to install command for a shorter execute command.
# * Delay between DM/Node agent start and server, if required.
# * Alternative way to tar/untar files and, generally, replace any use of bash commands where possible.
# * Add more "guards" and checks to make sure everything is working!
# * Ensure variables only work when the host has a specific name - needed as soon as install goes multi-node!
# * Use chef resources to enable/disable services, not bash shell commands.
